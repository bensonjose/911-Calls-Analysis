# 911-Calls-Analysis

**What is a 911 call?**<br>
**An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. When you call 911, be prepared to answer the call-taker's questions, which may include: The location of the emergency, including the street address.**<br>

In this project, I've used the following libraries<br>
**01.pandas**<br>pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.<br>
**02.numpy**<br>NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. <br>
**03.matplotlib**<br>Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.<br>
**04.seaborn**<br>Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. It will be used to visualize random distributions.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
In this project we analyze queries such as <br>
**Top 5 zipcodes for 911 calls**<br>
**the top 5 townships (twp) for 911 calls**<br>
**Create New Features**<br>
**Commmon reasons for a 911 call**<br>


**I've also used seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data, so viewers can understand the data in an easy manner.**<br>
